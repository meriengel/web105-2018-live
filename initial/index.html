    <h2>Why I study</h2>
    <p>I'm often asked if Karate is relevant in 
    a world that has so much gun violence. I don't
    study Karate with the thought that I am going 
    to disarm a gunman. I study Karate primarily for the health benefits, but also for the mental training. I don't think like a victim. I am aware of my surroundings and have a plan to protect myself.</p>
